"""
The sequence is first split into non-overlapped small windows. 
Each contains input_size numbers and each is considered as one independent input element.
Then any num_steps consecutive input elements are grouped into one training input,
forming an 'un-rolled' version of RNN for training on Tensorfow.
The corresponding label is the input element right after them.
